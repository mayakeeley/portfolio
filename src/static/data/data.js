      "Client project: I worked as part of a team of nine on a client project as part of the _nology training course. During this time we used agile principles, working in sprints with daily standups and weekly retrospectives. The concept was to create a platform for the In Collaboration community to connect on and share ideas and projects. We implemented the use of trello, user stories and paired programming. I worked in a variety of roles, running a retrospective, leading meetings with the client and on the code itself. I, and another team member, taught ourselves how to use firebase functions to send notifications to a mailing list when a post is created on the app."

Rules: each field is either empty, mine or number (1-8). Generate a rectangular field based on input number of rows and columns. Place mines randomly in the field – there can be only one mine in each field. Calculate the number clues and display the field. Output: simple visualisation of uncovered game board."
